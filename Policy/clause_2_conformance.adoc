== Conformance

This policy defines a series of policy requirements for OGC API standards.

Conformance with this policy shall be checked manually through review, or through automation where possible.

A checklist is provided for each Standards Working Group (SWG) to document how it complies with the guidelines and if any exemptions to the guidelines apply.

Completed checklists are to be reviewed by the OAB in order for candidate standards to be considered for Public Requests for Comment (RFC).
